                Many a times ,while learning a language we stumble upon some very little(or big ) errors while learning HTML and CSS.
                Sometimes these errors are so basic that we feel shy to consult about them wth our collaegues or teachers.
                These doubts put a lot of hassle on us as majority of books and sites only cover information from intrmediate level and not from basic level.
                    TO save your precious tue and energy from such situatiosn we have a FIRST AID KIT with us just for those basic bruises and cuts(but you should prefer a doctor in real case scenario:) )
