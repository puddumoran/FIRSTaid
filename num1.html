                <h3>DOCTYPE</h3>
                <p>

                    Every HTML document should start with a special line of code that declares its document type. The document type declaration, also known as the doctype for short. Immediately following the opening <is a !, followed by the word doctype, without any spaces in between. While at least one space is required between the word doctype and html, as always, you can have as many spaces everywhere else in the tag. Note that the doctype declaration does not have a closing tag. The case of any of the letters in the doctype declaration doesn’t matter either. You can even mix and match upper and lower case letters. For example, all of the doctype declarations below are valid and achieve the same outcome: 
                
               > </p>
                </div>
                <div class=header>
                    <h3>The HEAD tag</h3>
                    <p>Most of the metadata about the document goes inside of the head element. The term metadata literally means data about data. In our case, it’s the data about the HTML document.

                        This head section allows you to specify what CSS styles to use in the HTML document, the author’s description of the page, page title, what Javascript to execute, as well as different <meta> tags that specify things like what character encoding the document was written in.
                        Note that the meta tag is a standalone tag. There is no closing tag.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="title">
                    <h3>TITLE</h3>
                    <p>The head section of our document is still invalid. While declaring the character encoding is a good idea, it’s not required. What is required, however, is for the head element to contain the title element. Without the title element present, the page is invalid.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="body">
                    <h3>Body</h3>
                    <p>The body Element
                        The <body> tag is the root of all content that is visible to the user. It is often referred to as the viewport.
                        
                        No other tags are allowed between the closing </body> tag and the closing </html> tag. That means the closing </body> tag should be immediately followed by the closing </html> tag. As usual, spaces aren’t really considered content, so you can position the closing </html> tag on a new line and space it out however looks more readable to you.</p>
